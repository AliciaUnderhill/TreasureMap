# root reducer

# store

# react router and session components

# sessionForm components!

# session protected routes

# bootstrap current user

# update store with preloadedstate

# conditionally render the avatar input field

# ** I can leave tonight when there is a rendered sign up /login form and logout button on the site that works

DAY 2 WED:
# -How are my errors getting added to the Session slice of state and being rendered?

# -Create NavBar component
# give it all the parts that it needs
# conditionally render for signup and signin
# style it

# -Style form to look as close to real as possible (11)
-Figure out photo upload on session form -- what type of field should this be? (watch AWS videos) (12)
# -Begin styling out navbar (end of day)
# -Create a working sign out dropdown (Abby suggested making this a local component state slice)

# -create a demo user login
# -remove lines on signup/signin lis on navbar
# -change text for logo and map to be more semantic
-figure out the AWS image stuff and add that to form

-why does Heroku not work the same way localhost does?
-why is the background image not showing up?
